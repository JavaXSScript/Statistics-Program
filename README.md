# Statistics-Program

Made for my experiment project for my statistics class.

Because I needed to be quick and am not focused on compatibility, nor code optimization, this is very messsy and will only be guaranteed to work on Windows (sorry, Linux/Mac/Other OS users).

## How to run

Download and run "Stats.exe". A command prompt window will open, as well as a localhost webpage in the recommended browser of your choice. There will be 2 input fields, one to determine the number to generate to (0 - that number, exclusively). The second is how many random numbers you want to generate (up to 20 million).

After you generate, it should tell you what to do next. It lists the summary statistics, as well as a frequency distribution of the numbers generated.
